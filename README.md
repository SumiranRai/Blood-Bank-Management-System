# Blood-Bank
Did as a Web Development and SQL course project in my fifth semester along with Brother Lokesh Goenka.
Brother Lokesh made a major contribution to the project though. Very thankful to him.
We used html, css and javascript along with jquery for the front end development.
As for backend it was hosted on ApacheTomcat server and used SQL as a database for storing the data.
Very thankful to Sri P Sunil Kumar Sir for helping us with Java for the backend.

We have also tried to do the same with Node.js too in another version of it.
We couldn't upload the entire project but have uploaded only the front end for it.
